        <h1>Assignment 2a: Testing my understanding</h1>
        <p>
            During the pandemic, you couldn't do much except stay indoors. While staying in doors, I notice that one source of media that was benefiting from the pandemic was <strong>streaming and the rise to many streamers</strong> that grew in fame. I guess during the pandemic where everyone was lock in doors, many were on their phone or on their computers which would spur on this increase of streameres and active watchers. For instance, during my time at home I found many popular streamer from oversea under the group name of <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hololive" title="Holoive's YouTube Channel" target="_blank"><strong>Hololive</strong></a> which grown significantly overtime during the pandemic. Some notable members from Hololive which I actively watch during the pandemic were <strong>Nekomata Okayu, Inugami Korone, and Tokino Sora</strong> to name a few. Each of them run their own channel but all are under the same company/agency. As a result it is exciting to watch and enjoy the growth and entertainment that each one them provides to their viewers in their own unique way. Overall, while the pandemic was bad for almost everyone, I think that in some ways, the pandemic help others find new hobbies, such as myself, and allow others out there to turn this terrible situation around.
